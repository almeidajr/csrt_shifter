That's not little!
That's a really big problem.

192

Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?

193

Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

Happy now?
We came. We saw them.

Now let's go before
they light the torches.

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,607
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

197
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:17,941
Hey! That was for my own...

198
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,487
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go
back inside and pretend we're not home.

Harold! We have to be...

200
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,866
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

201
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:28,285
Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be...

202
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,704
A disaster! There is no way...

203
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,414
- You can do this.
- But I really...

00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,447
[Donkey] What do you mean,
"not on the list?"

222
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,365
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

223
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:52,369
Hey! What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

224
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:53,787
I had the hardest time
finding this place.

225

No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

226
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,626
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.

227
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,338
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- Yep, that's me: the noble steed.

228
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,466
Hey, waiter!
How about a bowl for the steed?

Mmmm!

234

No, no. Darling.

00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,315
Oh! [nervous chuckling]

236
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,528
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.

237
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:28,030
Well...

238
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,200
Shrek owns his own land.

239
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,744
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

240
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:36,663
It's in an enchanted forest...

241
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,249
...abundant in squirrels

242
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,919
and cute little duckies and...

243
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,713
What? [laughing] I know you
ain't talking about the swamp.

244
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,884
- Donkey!
- An ogre from a swamp. How original.

245
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,554
Well, I suppose that would be
a fine place to raise the children.

246

- [sputtering]
- [choking]

247
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:05,859
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

248
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,862
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

249
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,115
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?

250
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,952
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

251
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,411
I got to go to the bathroom.

252
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,040
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

253
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:26,922

Oh, Mexican food! My favorite.

255
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,970
Well, let's not just sit here with
our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.

256
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,555
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

257
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:38,475
So, I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...

258
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,519
Ogres, yes!

259
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,230
Not that there's anything wrong
with that. Right, Harold?

260
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,899
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

261
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,069
That is, assuming you don't
eat your own young!

- Dad!
- Oh, no.

263
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,658
We usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

264
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,160
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I loved her.

265
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,497
Aye, day care
or dragon-guarded castle.

266
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,624
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

267
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,633
It's so nice to have the family
together for dinner.

- What?

341

I told you coming here was a bad idea.

342
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,933
You could have at least tried
to get along with my father.

343
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,144
You know, somehow I don't think
I was going to get Daddy's blessing,

00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,403
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?

That's not about to change.

I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

- [Lillian] You should. You started it.

361
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,850
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
Really! He's the ogre. Not me.

362
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,354
I think, Harold, you're taking
this a little too personally.

363
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,230
This is Fiona's choice.

364
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:03,026
Yes, but she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked out for her.

365
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:07,280
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... this thing?

Fiona does. And she'll
never forgive you if you don't.

when we were young and...

00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,673
We used to walk
down by the lily pond and...

- ...they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

our daughter has married a monster!

- Nothing, dear!

playing up a bit!

We need to talk.

Prince Charming?

It's been years.

When did you get back?

392
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,401
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.

393
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,988
After I endured blistering winds,
scorching desert...

394
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,198
I climbed to the highest room
in the tallest tower...

395

- And what does he find?

telling him that his princess...

400
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,759
- If I can just...
- ...is already married.

401
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:53,303

He didn't get there in time.

[gasping] Where are we?

406
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:09,110
Well, hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

407

OK... Two Renaissance Wraps,

409
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,788
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold,

410
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:21,831
- curly fries?
- No, thank you.

411
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:23,458
Sourdough soft taco, then?
What do you want?

412
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:24,667
No, really, I'm fine.

This comes with the Medieval Meal.

don't want me to go back on my part.

503
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,366
I know! I know.

504
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,997
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

505
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:21,250
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

506
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,920
Yeah, sure. Now let's go
bond with Daddy.

507
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:26,839
[loud purring]

508
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,554
Well, well, well, Donkey.

509
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:37,099
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

510
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,684
What are you talking about?
I ain't purring.

511
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:41,437
Oh, sure. What's next? A hug?

512
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:44,857
Shrek, donkeys don't purr. What do
you think I am, some kind of a...

513
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:48,277
Ha-ha! Fear me! If you dare!

514
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,363
- [hissing]
- Hey, look! A little cat.

515
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,866
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

516
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,160
- Come here, little kitty, kitty, kitty.
- [growling]

517
00:33:56,327 --> 00:33:59,956
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

518
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,666
[yowling]

519
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,126
- [yelling]
- [yowling, hissing]

520
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,589
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

521
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,470
- [yowling]
- [yelling]

522
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,973
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

523
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,226
- Shrek! Hold still!
- [grunting] Oh...

524
00:34:20,393 --> 00:34:21,477
Did I miss?

525
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:24,605
- No. You got them.
- [meowing]

526
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,445
Now, ye ogre,
pray for mercy from...

527
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,199
...Puss... In Boots.

528
00:34:35,366 --> 00:34:37,660
Ooh! I'll kill that cat!

529
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:41,831
Ha ha! [coughing, choking]

530
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,835
[wheezing]

531
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:55,386
[retches, coughing]

532
00:34:56,804 --> 00:35:00,725
- [chuckling] Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

533
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,644
What do you reckon
we should do with him?

534
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,688
I say we take the sword
and neuter him right here.

535
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,023
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

536
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,026
[sobbing] Oh, no! <i>Por favor!</i>
Please, I implore you!

537
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:11,694
It was nothing personal, <i>Señor.</i>

538
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,697
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.

539
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:17,241
And my father lives off the garbage!

540
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:20,036
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

541
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

542
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,041
Fiona's father paid you to do this?

543
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,084
The rich King? <i>Sí.</i>

544
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:28,919
[yowling]

545
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:33,549
[sighing] Well, so much
for Dad's royal blessing.

546
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,384
Come on, Shrek. Don't feel bad.

547
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,386
Almost everybody that meets
you wants to kill you.

548
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,929
Gee, thanks.

549
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,807
[heavy sigh]

550
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:46,020
Maybe Fiona would've been better off
if I were some sort of Prince Charming.

551
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,022
That's what the King said.

552
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:52,735
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that
question was directed at me.

553
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,781
Shrek, Fiona knows
you'd do anything for her.

554
00:35:56,947 --> 00:36:00,326
Well, it's not like I wouldn't
change if I could.

555
00:36:00,493 --> 00:36:01,911
I just...

556
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:04,246
I just wish I could make her happy.

557
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:07,917
Hold the phone...

558
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,671
"Happiness.

559
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,840
A tear drop away."

560
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,427
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

561
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:21,097
Ah, man, where do I begin?

562
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:24,225
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

563
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,936
I ain't never got over that.
Then this fool had a party

564
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,397
and he have the guests
trying to pin the tail on me.

565
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:33,526
Then they got drunk and start beating
me with a stick, going "Piñata!"

566
00:36:33,693 --> 00:36:34,902
What is a piñata, anyway?

567
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:37,446
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

568
00:36:37,613 --> 00:36:40,741
Don't go projecting on me. I know you're
feeling bad, but you got to let...

569
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,618
[yelling]

570
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,664
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

571
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,798
<i>What? Is it on? Is it on?</i>

572
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,968
<i>[clearing throat]
This is Fairy Godmother.</i>

573
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,888
<i>I'm either away from my desk or with
a client. But if you come by the office,</i>

574
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:05,891
<i>we'll be glad to make you
a personal appointment.</i>

575
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,810
<i>Have a "happy ever after."</i>

576
00:37:10,312 --> 00:37:12,064
Oh...

577
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,400
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?

578
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:15,693
All right, that's more like it!

579
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,987
Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

580
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:21,532
<i>♪ Ain't no stoppin' us now!
Whoo! We're on the move! ♪</i>

581
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:26,287
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

582
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,789
On my honor,
I am obliged to accompany you

583
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,625
until I have saved your life
as you have spared me mine.

584
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:35,713
I'm sorry, the position of annoying
talking animal has already been taken.

585
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,591
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

586
00:37:47,516 --> 00:37:50,770
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

587
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,730
...in his wee little boots.

588
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:56,358
You know, how many cats
can wear boots? Honestly.

589
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,277
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

590
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,696
[purring]

591
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:01,947
[groaning]

592
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,824
Aw, listen. He's purring!

593
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:06,994
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

594
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,664
Lighten up? I should lighten up.
Look who's telling who to lighten up!

595
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,544
[giggling] Shrek...

596
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:17,213
[whimpering]

597
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:18,672
[barking]

598
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:21,550
Shrek?

599
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,065
They're both festive, aren't they?
What do you think, Harold?

600
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,109
Um... Yes. Yes, fine. Fine.

601
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,903
[sighing]

602
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,405
Try to at least pretend
that you're interested

603
00:38:43,572 --> 00:38:44,990
in your daughter's wedding ball.

604
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,243
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it really matters.

605
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,745
How do we know there's
even going to be a ball?

606
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:51,455
Mom. Dad.

607
00:38:51,622 --> 00:38:55,709
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

608
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,920
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

609
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:00,881
I haven't. You should ask your father.

610
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:05,553
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

611
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,181
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

612
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:11,725
Mmm... Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?

613
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:14,937
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.

614
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,357
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

615
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:22,903
- Dad? Have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

616
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,782
I'm sure he just went off to look
for a nice mud hole to cool down in.

617
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,118
You know,
after your little spat last night.

618
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:32,955
- Oh. You heard that, huh?
- Darling, the whole kingdom heard you.

619
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:36,166
I mean, after all,
it is in his nature to be,

620
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,210
well, a bit of a brute.

621
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:42,047
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the welcome wagon.

622
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,467
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

623
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:49,471
[gasping]
Shrek loves me for who I am.

624
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,974
I would think you'd be happy for me.

625
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:55,519
Darling, I'm just thinking about
what's best for you.

626
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:58,480
Maybe you should do the same.

627
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,322
[indistinct whispering]

628
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,080
- No, really?
- Hm-hm.

629
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,665
[both chuckling]

630
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,125
[Puss in Boots] Shh...

631
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:21,545
Oh...

632
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,883
[bell whistling]

633
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,261
Oh, no, that's the old Keebler's place.
Let's just back away slowly.

634
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:31,263
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.

635
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,850
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

636
00:40:35,017 --> 00:40:38,312
Then why don't we pop in there
for a spell? [chuckling] Spell.

637
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:41,398
[hysterical laughter]

638
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,527
[Puss in Boots]
He makes me laugh.

639
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:53,202
Hi. I'm here to see the...

640
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,330
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.

641
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:59,375
<i>[Fairy Godmother] Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!</i>

642
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:00,668
[sighing]

643
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:03,712
Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away.

644
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:06,715
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, OK?

645
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,676
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.

646
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,052
The union?

647
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:14,556
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

648
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,392
Oh! Right.

649
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,520
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

650
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:23,232
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.

651
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,234
They don't even have dental.

652
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,611
OK, we're just gonna
have a look around.

653
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:29,822
Oh, by the way,
I think it'd be better

654
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:32,074
if the Fairy Godmother
didn't know we were here.

655
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,369
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

656
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:38,497
- Stop it.
- [whispers] Of course. Go right in.

657
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,584
[indistinct chatter, noise]

658
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,774
[explosion]

659
00:42:07,985 --> 00:42:09,778
[Fairy Godmother]
A drop of desire.

660
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:12,698
[giggling] Naughty.

661
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,576
A pinch of passion.

662
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,328
[laughing]

663
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:23,625
And just a hint of...

664
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:24,960
...lust!

665
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,631
- [laughing]
- Excuse me.

666
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:32,134
- [gasps]
- Sorry to barge in like this, but...

667
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,012
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

668
